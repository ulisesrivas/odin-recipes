build a basic recipe website to practice HTML on TOP

This is a simple project from TOP to build a basic recipe website. It'll consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. 
This project is also for me to run plenty of commits. To demonstrate that I can work in a team environment effectively and that I can build individual projects on my own in a responsible manner.
This project is just to build my HTML chops; I will revisit thsi project in the future to style it up with CSS.
